# Logico
Python logical equation calculator.
The original Logico.py file is a one py file monstrosity for easy sharing, this Github repo has its contents split up into multiple py files for easier reading.

Logico can calculate truth table outcomes for boolean logic statements. Operators can be described with their explicit symbol or using the corresponding shortcut code.

IE: "p.and.q" is the same as saying "p∧q".
-  Conditional: →  .so.
-  And: ∧ .and.
-  Or: ∨ .or.
-  Inversion: ¬ .not.
-  Biconditional: ↔ .eq.
-  XOR: ⊕ .xor.
-  NAND: ↑ .nand.
-  NOR: ↓ .nor.
-  Logical Equivalence: ≡ .is.
  
Additionally, if you express two logical equations separated by "≡", the program will compare their resulting truth tables to determine logical equivalence.
